# BrightHR Junior/Mid task - Dan Mahony

## Setup

In order to access the project, navigate to your preferred folder and run 

```
git@github.com:djmahony/brightHrJunior.git
```

Followed by:

```
cd brightHrJunior
```

The next stage will be to install the dependances using:

```
npm install
```

Once this is finished you can run the unit tests with the following command:

```
npm test
```

To run the project run:

```
npm start
```

## Improvements

With more time I would have updated more of the styles, and also I would have created other components to handle the Sort/Filter and Breadcrumbs. I would also build unit tests around the sorting and filtering of the files
